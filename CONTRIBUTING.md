# Contributing

Feature suggestions and bug reports are welcome. PRs must be linked to an open issue.

## How to contribute

1. **Open an issue first** — use the Feature Request or Bug Report template
2. **Wait for feedback** — the issue will be discussed before any PR is accepted
3. **Open a PR** — reference the issue with `Closes #123` in the PR description

PRs without a linked issue will not be reviewed.
